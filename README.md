# Exploring Bikeshare Dynamics with Advanced Analytics and Predictive Modeling like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM (linear & non-linear)  

This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project based on the Bikeshare data of Washington, D.C. for February, March, and April 2024. The project focuses on assessing bike and dock availability through pickup and drop-off counts and integrates local weather data to examine the impacts on bikeshare traffic. The core objective is to optimize bike allocations by predicting whether pickups exceed drop-offs using classification models. The analysis includes data merging, cleaning, and extensive visualization of bikeshare and weather data. The project progresses into predictive modeling where different machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are evaluated to find the best performer in predicting bikeshare traffic conditions. Logistic Regression, in particular, demonstrated the highest testing accuracy, indicating its superior generalization capabilities for this dataset. This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in data analytics within urban planning or transportation sectors, providing insights into handling, visualizing, and modeling complex datasets to inform operational decisions in real-time environments.
